# gsqsa_basket
*An analysis of the GSQSA Basketball Team 2022/2023 stats.*

## How it works
The program reads single game stats from a local Excel and outputs each player's average and total stats, as well as gsqsa and opponent team's ones.

### TODO list
1. fill nas with 0 in tab sum
2. add team stats
4. add checks
    1. field goals attempted >= field goals made
    2. max 5 fouls commited per player
